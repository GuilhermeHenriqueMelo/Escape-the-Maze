# Escape-the-Maze
Simple Algorithm to find an exit from a Maze

This project is just a simple "game" where the computer has to find the exit of labyrinth. At first I'll make this in the C language, and then
"upgrade" the level of implementation.

What I'm aspiring to do is the following:

C -> C++ -> C++ with GUI -> C# with GUI

Thank you! :)
